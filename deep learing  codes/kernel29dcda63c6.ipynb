The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2008, and is regarded as the brainchild of Lalit Modi, the founder and former commissioner of the league. IPL has an exclusive window in ICC Future Tours Programme.\nThe IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast live on YouTube. The brand value of IPL in 2018 was US Dollar 6.3 billion, according to Duff & Phelps. According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹11.5 billion (US Dollar 182 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy.\nThere have been eleven seasons of the IPL tournament. The current IPL title holders are the Chennai Super Kings, who won the 2018 season. The most successful franchises in the tournament are the Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians with 3 tournament wins each.**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/matches.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3e267e94253ec0571a4e9adcb6f8021a4b32c441"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Selecting top 3 rows from the dataframe\ndf.head(3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d02c9a90956c1a058ff21cc8ec74c8a9af704caa"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Let's check then number of observations in the data.**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"9ab384c5c082386805d70ac1df06545d7a62fc16"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Fetching number of rows in the dataframe\ndf.shape[0]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f67af4ca28276f9814f4294531d18dbc70e97ad2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Let's check the number of matches each team won till now in the IPL history.**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5ba183aa85e0bd25c1bcd3071d7aec9bc97f1263"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['winner'].sort_values().value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"016629f5df75472fa0c550a42844cc65398a0fae"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Did you notice that we have \"Rising Pune Supergiant\" 2 times in the above list.
